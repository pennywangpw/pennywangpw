##I'm a traveler, developer and foodie!

Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Express, Flask, HTML/CSS, SQL and gained valuable experience working independently as well as collaboratively within a team. Utilizing agile methodology, I successfully contributed to the completion of various projects.

Here are my projects, please feel free to check them out:

I am enthusiastic about pursuing opportunities that allow me to leverage my background in software engineering :)
