### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a traveler, developer and foodie!

Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Express, Flask, HTML/CSS, SQL and gained valuable experience working independently as well as collaboratively within a team. Utilizing agile methodology, I successfully contributed to the completion of various projects.

Here are my projects, please feel free to check them out:

#CouchBooking
#Remember that Flask
#SplitEZ

I find great satisfaction in leveraging technology as a software engineer to make life more convenient and accessible for people!
